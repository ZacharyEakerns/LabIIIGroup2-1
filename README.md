Automatic "Smart" Home and Bioinformatics Monitoring System

Project's goal is to design a system that will be used to monitor the status of a person's wellbeing (such as an elderly person in a retirement home) that will monitor and react to the movement of the person.  The system will monitor the vitals (Heart Rate (EKG), Oxygen in the blood, Breathing Rate, as well as other necessary information) and position within a set boundary to act as the "home". The boundry will contain items that will react to various situations. For example, if the elderly person wants to be cool whenever they are in a certain "room", each time they enter that "room" a fan will turn on. Lights should turn on and off as the person move throughout the room. There should be at least 2 major appliances or objects that should react to the persons face and voice (e.g. winking into a camera or some facial gesture will turn on or off a TV, or saying something by the person should be able to turn on or off the TV). There is a door for this project which should be made automatic for the person.
